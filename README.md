# web3Transceiver
my version of buildspace's intro to web3 wave project.  Instead of waving to other users I replaced the wave with a transmission function to send a signal into the ether.  

## Future Plans
 - To start I will follow the buildspace guide, with a wave function and plain react.
 - Eventually I will replace the standard walkthrough with typescript and a transmission theme over wave.
